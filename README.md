This repo contains the CINPLA logo. 

![`cinpla.png`: red-blue logo with text](cinpla-logo.png)

The following folders contain variations of the logo:

- logo-only: The logo without the CINPLA text.
- original: The original SVG files, which may depend on fonts to be installed. We recommend using the SVG in the root folder instead.
- small: A variation of the logo with less details, which may be useful if the logo is small on screen or print.
- text-only: Only the cinpla text.

You may download all the logos at once by clicking the green button above.

Do not link to the logos in this repository as the files may be moved in the future.
